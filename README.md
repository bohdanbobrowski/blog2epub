# blogspot2epub
Convert any blogspot blog to epub using single command!

Main features:
- downloads all text contents of selected blog to epub file,
- downloads post comments,
- downloads images, resizes them (to 800x600px) and converts to grayscale,
- one post = one chapter,
- chapters are sorted by date ascending,
- optional: it adds cover, if you add jpg file with the same name like blog you want to download (sample.jpg for sample.blogspot.com),

Its still very experimental, but should work... generally.

Example:
./blogspot2epub.py starybezpiek
./blogspot2epub.py poznanskiehistorie

Happy reading!
:-)
