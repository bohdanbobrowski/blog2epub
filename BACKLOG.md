# List of features and bugfixes I'm considering to add

## Known bugs
- [ ] it does not support Arabic, Japanese, Georgian nor many other alphabets and encodings... but this will be my goal in future versions.

## Scraping in general:
- [ ] stop with keeping content in RAM - save it as ready to use ebook chapters
- [ ] replace blog internal url's in article content to actual chapters in ebook
- [ ] support for blog categories, tags and pages
- [ ] manually decide which crawler should be used
- [ ] blog2epub.yaml - this might be too ambitious, but what if user could compose he's/hers own book, with custom
  cover, metadata and which contain articles from different blogs and websites around the web? A dockerfile.yaml for
  ebooks.

## GUI, CLI and app distribution
- [ ] GUI translations
- [ ] publish app on Google Play Store (in progress)
- [ ] publish app on F-Droid (in progress)
- [ ] add some linux packages: aur looks promising, and dmg aswell - what about Flatpak, Snap and Appimage?
